## Premise

GROW is a text-based role-playing game designed to pass the [1001 Desires Test](https://capricorn-0mnikorn.tumblr.com/post/633330323882688512/a-bechdel-style-test-for-disabled-characters-you):
- There must be a disabled person;
- Who wants something besides either A. a cure to their disability, B. revenge, or C. to die;
- The disabled person does not get cured or die at the end.

In GROW, you have recently survived an accident that resulted in permanent paralysis and dissociative amnesia. You move back to your childhood town, but you don't remember the town, or the people in it. You have the opportunity to grow plants and trade them with townspeople as you try to understand more about who you were... and who you could be.
